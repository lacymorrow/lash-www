_Created: 2024-12-28_
_Status: Planning Phase_

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive audit plan for the Shipkit codebase to identify and fix performance issues, code smells, and optimization opportunities. The audit focuses on Next.js App Router best practices, React performance patterns, and database optimization.

## üéØ Goals

- [ ] Reduce bundle size and improve loading performance
- [ ] Optimize database queries and prevent N+1 patterns
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary client-side JavaScript
- [ ] Improve component reusability and maintainability
- [ ] Standardize error handling and caching strategies
- [ ] Ensure proper separation of concerns between client/server

## üìã Audit Checklist

### Phase 1: Component Architecture Audit

#### ‚úÖ 1. Client Components Audit (`use client`)

**Status: Pending**
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 4-6 hours**

**Objective**: Identify components marked with `"use client"` that don't actually need client-side features and can be converted to Server Components for better performance.

**Areas to Review**:

- [ ] Components using `"use client"` without hooks or browser APIs
- [ ] Server Components nested in Client Components (should be passed as props/children)
- [ ] Data fetching happening in `useEffect` (should move to Server Components)
- [ ] Static components unnecessarily marked as client

**Key Files Found**:

- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Complex client-side logic with hydration issues
- `src/hooks/use-local-storage.ts` - Good example of proper client component
- `src/components/forms/contact-form.tsx` - Review if form needs to be fully client-side
- `src/app/(app)/connect/github/page.tsx` - Has custom client wrapper logic

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% reduction in client JavaScript bundle size

#### ‚úÖ 2. Large File Breakdown

**Status: Pending**
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Time: 6-8 hours**

**Objective**: Break down files exceeding 500-700 lines into smaller, focused components following atomic design principles.

### Bugfix: NextAuth credential flows

- [x] Fixed logic in `src/server/services/auth-service.ts` for `signInWithCredentials` and `signUpWithCredentials` to properly handle NextAuth `signIn` behavior.
  - For `redirect: true`, call `signIn` and return immediately (fallback return value documented).
  - For `redirect: false`, evaluate the result object (`ok`, `error`, `url`) and report failures correctly.
  - Ensures failed authentication/sign-up attempts are not reported as successful.

### Bugfix: Graceful auth fallback when providers/DB are disabled

- [x] Implemented safe JSON responses when authentication is not configured.
  - Updated `src/server/auth.ts` to return a structured JSON error (`503 Service Unavailable`) from `GET` and `POST` handlers when `AUTH_ENABLED` is false.
  - Prevents "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors by avoiding empty handler responses.

### Phase 7: Keyboard Shortcuts Audit & Conflict Resolution

#### ‚úÖ 7.1 Keyboard Shortcut Conflicts Audit

**Status: Completed - December 28, 2024**
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

**Objective**: Audit keyboard shortcuts across the application to identify and resolve conflicts, overlapping shortcuts, and misleading UI indicators.

**Issues Found**:

- **Multiple Search Conflict**: Both `SearchMenu` and `DocsSearch` components used same `OPEN_SEARCH_MENU` action
- **Misleading UI**: DocsSearch displayed `‚åòK` but actually used `‚åò‚áßK` shortcut
- **Shortcut Overlap**: Same shortcuts triggered multiple search modals on docs pages
- **Inconsistent UX**: Users confused by multiple search types with conflicting shortcuts

**Completed Tasks**:

- [x] Identified all keyboard shortcut implementations across codebase
- [x] Mapped current shortcut assignments and conflicts
- [x] Removed keyboard shortcut from DocsSearch component
- [x] Removed misleading `‚åòK` display from DocsSearch UI
- [x] Consolidated all search shortcuts to single `OPEN_SEARCH` action
- [x] Updated all search components to use unified shortcut
- [x] Documented final keyboard shortcut mapping

**Technical Changes**:

- **Removed from DocsSearch**: `useKeyboardShortcut` hook integration and visual indicator
- **Consolidated Actions**: Replaced `OPEN_COMMAND_MENU`, `OPEN_SEARCH_MENU`, and `OPEN_AI_SEARCH` with single `OPEN_SEARCH`
- **Updated Components**: SearchMenu, SearchAi, and CommandMenu all use `OPEN_SEARCH`
- **Simplified Config**: Reduced from 4 search shortcuts to 1 universal shortcut
- **Result**: One search shortcut works with whatever search component is visible

**Final Keyboard Shortcut Mapping**:

- `mod+K` ‚Üí **Universal Search** (opens whatever search is visible on page)
- `/` ‚Üí **Universal Search** (alternative shortcut)
- All other app shortcuts remain unchanged

**Files Modified**:

- `src/config/keyboard-shortcuts.ts` - Consolidated search actions to single `OPEN_SEARCH`
- `src/components/search/search-menu.tsx` - Updated to use `OPEN_SEARCH`
- `src/components/search/search-ai.tsx` - Updated to use `OPEN_SEARCH`
- `src/components/blocks/command-menu.tsx` - Updated to use `OPEN_SEARCH`
- `src/app/(app)/docs/_components/docs-search.tsx` - Removed keyboard shortcut integration

**Expected Impact**:

- ‚úÖ Eliminated keyboard shortcut conflicts on all pages
- ‚úÖ Simplified UX with single, predictable search shortcut
- ‚úÖ Universal `‚åòK` works regardless of which search component is visible
- ‚úÖ Reduced cognitive load - users only need to remember one shortcut

**Results Achieved**:

- ‚úÖ Consolidated 4 different search shortcuts into 1 universal shortcut
- ‚úÖ `‚åòK` now works with any search component visible on page
- ‚úÖ Eliminated all keyboard shortcut conflicts across entire application
- ‚úÖ Simplified user experience - one shortcut to rule them all
- ‚úÖ Reduced codebase complexity with unified search action

## Feature: Lash CLI Landing Hero (TUI-themed)

Status: Planning

Goal: Create a single-section landing hero at `/` in `lash-www` that mirrors the Lash TUI brand (pinks, blues, diagonal field motif), to validate look-and-feel before expanding the site.

### TUI Theme Reference ‚Üí Web Mapping

- Source (TUI): `internal/tui/styles/charmtone.go`, `internal/tui/styles/theme.go`, `internal/tui/components/logo/logo.go`
- Key palette (approx Tailwind mapping):
  - Primary (Charple) ‚Üí violet-500/600
  - Secondary (Dolly) ‚Üí fuchsia-500/pink-500
  - Info/Blue (Malibu) ‚Üí sky-400/indigo-400
  - Accent (Zest) ‚Üí amber-400 (sparingly)
- Motifs to mirror:
  - Foreground gradient from Secondary ‚Üí Primary (pink ‚Üí violet) for wordmark/heading
  - Diagonal field lines (ASCII `‚ï±`) as a subtle background pattern
  - Dark canvas with blue‚Üíviolet‚Üípink gradient accents

### Implementation Plan

- [x] Review TUI theme and identify color/motif mapping
  - Identified `Primary=Charple` and `Secondary=Dolly` as gradient endpoints; `Malibu` blue for highlights.
  - Logo/splash uses diagonal field and horizontal foreground gradient; we‚Äôll mirror via CSS gradients and a subtle animated grid.
- [x] Add homepage route `src/app/page.tsx` (Server Component)
  - Done ‚Äî Created server page rendering `LashHero` within `Suspense`.
- [x] Create `src/components/landing/lash-hero.tsx` (Server Component)
  - Done ‚Äî Gradient heading, subcopy, primary/secondary CTAs, brew install snippet, diagonal field motif.
- [x] Background animation (Client Component)
  - Done ‚Äî Reused `BackgroundSpacetime` with low opacity; hero remains server-rendered.
- [x] CTAs
  - Done ‚Äî Install Lash (`/install`) and GitHub repo link.
- [x] Accessibility & Responsiveness
  - Done ‚Äî Semantic heading, accessible buttons/links, responsive typography/spacing.
- [x] Performance
  - Done ‚Äî No large assets; lightweight background; no extra client logic in page.
- [x] QA checklist
  - Done ‚Äî Verified mobile and desktop layouts; dark-mode consistent.

### Files to Add/Touch

- New: `src/app/page.tsx`
- New: `src/components/landing/lash-hero.tsx`
- Reuse: `src/components/ui/backgrounds/background-spacetime.tsx`, `src/components/ui/animated-gradient-text.tsx`, `src/components/ui/animated-shiny-text.tsx`

### Rollout

- Phase 1 (this task): Implement hero section only at `/` with final visuals.
- Phase 2 (next): Add content sections (features, install, examples) reusing site components and TUI motifs.

### Definition of Done

- Hero renders at `/` with TUI-like gradient heading, diagonal field/animated background, and working CTAs.
- Passes a11y checks (contrast, focus, semantics) and basic perf checks.

## Feature: Rebrand to Lash

- [x] Update `src/config/site-config.ts` (name, title, tagline, url, ogImage, description, links, repo, email, creator, metadata.keywords)
  - Set core brand values to Lash domain and repository.
- [x] Swap icon component to Lash (`src/components/assets/icon.tsx` -> `LashIcon`)
  - Added `src/components/assets/lash-icon.tsx` using Tabler Terminal icon for now.
- [x] Header CTA label update (`Get Shipkit` ‚Üí `Get Lash`) in `src/components/headers/header.tsx`.
- [x] Adjust brand colors in `src/styles/theme.css` to Lash violet/pink/blue palette.
- [x] Update external links in `src/config/routes.ts` to Lash URLs for site and Vercel deploy templates.
- [ ] Replace icons/assets in `public/` and `public/app/` (favicon, 192/512 app icons, `logo.png`, `og-image.png`, `og-logo.png`).
- [x] Replace icons/assets in `public/` and `public/app/` (favicon, 192/512 app icons, `logo.png`, `og-image.png`, `og-logo.png`).
  - Generated icons and OG assets from `public/logo.png` and `public/wide.png` using `sips`.
- [ ] Configure analytics envs for Lash (PostHog/Umami) and update `.env*`.
- [ ] Grep and update any remaining ‚ÄúShipkit‚Äù strings in marketing copy or tests where appropriate.

Notes:
- Metadata derives from `siteConfig` so updates cascade to OG/Twitter tags.
- Placeholder buy link left as `lash.lemonsqueezy.com/...` to be finalized.
