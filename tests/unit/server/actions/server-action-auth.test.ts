/**
 * Regression guard for LAC-4442 / LAC-3811 / LAC-3944.
 *
 * A `"use server"` directive at the top of a module publishes every export in
 * that module as a POST endpoint keyed by an action id. Nothing else gates it:
 * there is no `middleware.ts` in this repo, and a route group like `(admin)`
 * only gates the page that renders the button, never the action the button
 * posts to. So an export in one of these files with no session check is an
 * unauthenticated endpoint, no matter which folder it sits in.
 *
 * This class of hole shipped in three ShipKit forks before anyone caught it,
 * and the worst instance here was `configureSetup`, which created an admin
 * role and inserted a pre-verified admin user from caller-supplied input. A
 * sweep found it once; only a test keeps finding it. Hence this file.
 *
 * Two rules, both deliberately annoying to silence:
 *
 *   1. Every export of a `"use server"` module resolves the caller from the
 *      session, or is listed in `PUBLIC_BY_DESIGN` with a reason.
 *   2. No export of a `"use server"` module takes a caller identity (`userId`,
 *      `email`) as a parameter, unless listed in `IDENTITY_PARAM_ALLOWLIST`
 *      with a reason. A caller-supplied identity in a public endpoint is the
 *      confused deputy that made `verifyEmail(userId)` and
 *      `getAdminEmails(requestingEmail)` exploitable.
 *
 * Adding an entry to either list is the escape hatch. Write a real reason: the
 * next person reads it instead of re-deriving the threat model.

/**
 * Dead `"use server"` modules this fork deleted rather than guarded. Each was
 * an unauthenticated POST endpoint with no caller anywhere in the app, so
 * there was no behaviour to preserve:
 *
 *   configure-setup  created an admin role, granted `all:manage`, and inserted
 *                    a pre-verified admin user from caller-supplied input
 *   vercel           returned the whole `accounts` row for any user id,
 *                    including stored OAuth access and refresh tokens
 *   setup            created repositories and triggered deploys with the
 *                    owner's GitHub and Vercel credentials
 *   download-repo    served repository archives, including private ones
 *   chat-actions     billed the owner's OpenAI key for anonymous prompts
 *   rbac             enumerated any user's roles
 *   temporary-links  minted and re-read download links for any user id, and
 *                    reset their expiry on every read
 *   waitlist-actions wrote and read the waitlist with no caller
 *
 * Re-adding one, instead of syncing the upstream fix, is how this class
 * recurred across three forks (LAC-3811, LAC-3944, LAC-4442).
